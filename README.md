# AI-BII Project

## Overview
Welcome to the **AI-BII** project! This repository contains tools and scripts designed for AI-driven data analysis and processing. Our project leverages cutting-edge technologies to streamline workflows and enhance functionality for specific use cases. 

## Key Features
- **AI-Powered Analysis:** Implements machine learning algorithms to perform various tasks efficiently.
- **Customizable:** Allows for adjustments based on specific use case needs.
- **Dynamic Link Setup:** Utilizes ngrok to expose local servers to the internet for ease of access.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.8+**
- **pip** (Python package manager)

Additionally, you'll need to install ngrok, which can be downloaded from [ngrok's official website](https://ngrok.com/download).

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/XiaoyuYuan19/AI-BII.git
   cd AI-BII
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Configuration
#### Setting Up ngrok
The project requires an ngrok-generated link for certain functionalities. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. Start ngrok on your local machine:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 8000
   ```
   Replace `8000` with the port your application will run on.

2. Note the **Forwarding** URL provided by ngrok (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io`).

3. Update the configuration file in the project (e.g., `config.py` or a similar file as defined in the project files). Replace the placeholder link with your ngrok URL:
   ```python
   NGROK_URL = "https://abc123.ngrok.io"
   ```
   Ensure this matches the forwarding URL exactly.

## How to Use
1. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to the ngrok URL to access the application.

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the tool.

## Project Structure
- **`main.py`**: Entry point of the application.
- **`config.py`**: Configuration settings, including dynamic ngrok URL.
- **`modules/`**: Contains various modules and utilities for data processing and AI functionality.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of required Python packages.
- **`README.md`**: Documentation and setup instructions (this file).

## Troubleshooting
- **Problem:** Application not accessible via ngrok link.
  - **Solution:** Ensure ngrok is running, and the forwarding URL matches the `NGROK_URL` in `config.py`.

- **Problem:** Missing dependencies.
  - **Solution:** Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to ensure all dependencies are installed.
